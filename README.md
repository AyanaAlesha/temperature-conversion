 Converting celsius --> fahrenheit  and vice versa 

 The Temperature Conversion Tool is a web application that allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. Users input a temperature value and select the conversion type (Celsius to Fahrenheit or Fahrenheit to Celsius). Upon submitting, the tool instantly provides the converted temperature.

This project demonstrates the use of basic HTML for the user interface, JavaScript for handling user input and performing the conversion, and CSS for styling. It showcases how event handling and DOM manipulation can be used to build interactive web applications.
